# ContraptionZack-Copy
This is a copy of the first 4 areas of the DOS game "Contraption Zack"

Start in the TitleScreen.java class. 

Use the arrow keys to move the player towards the arrow. The first level is easy, but it gets a bit more tricky after that. Push buttons of corrdinating color to trigger the spikes down (smaller circles = spikes down, bigger ciricles = spikes up). There are also springs that will propel you across obstables. 

If you get stuck... which you probably will, press the esc key to either reset the area, or save your game. 

Do you have what it takes to beat contraption zack and get the hot chocolate recipe you always deserved?

~~~ Good Luck!
